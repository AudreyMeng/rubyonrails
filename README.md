# overview
All page will carry the page content from app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.

## application.html.erb
```ruby
<%= render %>
```
### render
Contents in render will always show up on webpage.

Here we have two renders: 
1, navbar: which will always show. Inside navbar it has a form expect data-target which is inside the other render new_question_form.

2, new_question_form: it only shows up when the form in navbar is trigered.

> renders are just html div layout partials, so **the html.erb file must start with a underscore**, but the url will remove teh underscore.

### yield
```ruby
<%= yield %>
```

yield will render contents from home#index as defined in config/routes.rb.

Then we can start from config/routes.rb, there are three main parts: root, GET question, POST.

## root
```ruby
root 'home#index'
```
So root page will be handled by home controller with index action. 

Two important files are:

1, app/views/home/index.html.erb defines page view.

2, app/controllers/home_controller.rb defines actions of home controller.

### \<a> href
In index, every question has a <a> with href="/questions/12" which will redirect page to the sublink of localhost:3000/questions/12.

routes.rb defines controller home and action question for it:
```ruby
get '/questions/:id' => 'home#question'
```
So there is a app/views/home/question.html.erb file to define page view.

### \<a> modal
In app/views/home/question.html.erb, <a> for answer is also defined to expect data-target modal: answerModal.
  
To render the modal:
```ruby
<%= render 'home/new_answer_form' %>
```
answerModal page view is defined in app/views/home/\_new_answer_form.html.erb.
